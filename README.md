# fashionMNIST

All of this code is written by me, and it's my python & numpy implementation of an MLP; so I do all the math.
I made this for my dissertation, which was basically an introduction to MLPs with the fashionMNIST as an example dataset for how neural networks worked.
The final test-set accuracy on this network was a bit over **88%**, which is decent since I did not use any convolutions, because at the time of writing the program I did not know how to implement them, i do now :D
